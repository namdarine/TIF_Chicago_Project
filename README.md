## Abstract - Joe


## Introduction - Lane
  We hope to relate information regarding income and education to TIF districts in Chicago. From further analysis, we aim to determine any inequalities that may have arisen alongside TIFs. Furthermore, we want to emphasize the “but for” clause of whether a TIF should exist at all by using factors of socioeconomic success. We hope the results of this project can further inform Chicago citizens of possible inequalities present in the current tax system of the city. 

  The project consists of four primary components: data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. For the data collection, we used the Chicago Data Portal website to obtain city boundary geodata in GeoJSON format (Chicago Data Portal, n.d.). We also sourced our demographic data from the U.S. Census data website, the information used was filtered by block group and downloaded in CSV format (Census Bureau Data, n.d.). To analyze the data, we used principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering methods to uncover statistically significant information. From our results, we created a novel visualization to display our findings understandably.
