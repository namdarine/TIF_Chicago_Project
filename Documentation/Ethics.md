## Stakeholder 1: Residents

### Problem
	: If our project generated a wrong answer that we concluded an area where they had funded their residents fairly and equally unfair. This conclusion could affect their TIF investment badly and mislead their funds to a rather unfair direction.

### Stakes
	: Residents want an accurate interpretation of TIF that will lead to more fair use of TIF.

### Solution
	: We need to guarantee that our project’s conclusion accurately depicts the current use of TIF in the city of Chiago.


## Stakeholder 2: Unwealthy population (Displaced)

### Problem
	: If our project concluded that TIF was helping their community for a certain community area so it led to expansion of the TIF area within the community area. It would burden an unwealthy population who had been living in the non-TIF area to a point where they couldn’t afford TIF taxes and end up leaving the area, which can be called gentrification.

### Stakes
	: Lower income populations won't be able to afford increased taxes and could be gentrified.

### Solution
: The impact our study could have on disadvantaged groups of people must be carefully considered. Since this project is to address possible unfairness that creates discrepancy between different ethnic groups, we need to make sure it doesn’t rather aggravate it.
