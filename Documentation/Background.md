## Background
### Understanding of boundaries - Lane
When choosing what boundaries to use we had to ensure we would be able to acquire the correct data based on those boundaries and ensure the areas we were working with werenâ€™t too large or small. TIF districts on average are fairly small and generally coincide with census tracts and block groups in relative areas. Therefore we originally chose to work with census tracts as a happy medium for boundary size, however, we later decided block groups would be better to use. The smaller size of block groups made it easier to differentiate whole community areas between TIF and non-TIF.
