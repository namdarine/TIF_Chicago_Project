## Conclusion

In conclusion, various metrics have shown that there are slightly higher increments in white dominant neighborhoods within TIF areas, compared to the TIF areas of Black dominant, and hispanic dominant community areas. We interpret that the results have shown unequal investment of TIF. We hope to make it accessible for the general body, deliver this project to local journals or the government to gain their attention. 


## Limitation
We cannot conclude that the higher increase within the white dominant TIF area was only determined by TIF. Given that median income of white dominant areas is already higher than other areas, they could have just invested the assets better and it might have led to the higher increase. In other words, since economic growth is played by multiple factors, it is hard to define the unfair investment of TIF as the only factor that has to be revised.
