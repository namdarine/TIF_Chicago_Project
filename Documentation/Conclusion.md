## Conclusion

To sum up, our research has shown observable differences in how Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is distributed among various ethnic groupings. In particular, the data suggests that the rate of increment in communities with a larger concentration of White people within TIF-designated areas is higher than that of neighborhoods with a higher concentration of Black and Hispanic residents. These results point to an unequal TIF investment distribution, which could exacerbate ongoing inequality. We want to share these results as far as possible, not only to educate the public but also to include local government representatives and media organizations. By doing this, we hope to encourage a more fair distribution of TIF funds and to spark enlightened public discussion on this important problem.
