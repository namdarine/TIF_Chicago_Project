## Conclusion

In conclusion, various metrics have shown that within TIF districts, there are slightly higher increases in income in predominantly white neighborhoods compared to the TIF areas that are predominantly Black or Latino communities. We interpreted that the results have shown unequal investment of TIF. We hope to make it accessible to the general body and deliver this project to local journals or the government to gain more attention. 


## Limitation
We cannot conclude that the higher increase within the white-dominant TIF areas was only determined by TIF. Given that the median income of white-dominant areas is already higher than other areas, they could have just invested the assets better, which could lead to an increase in wealth. In other words, since economic growth has multiple factors, it is hard to label the unfair investment of TIF as the only factor.
