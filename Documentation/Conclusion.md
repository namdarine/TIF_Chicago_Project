## Conclusion

In conclusion, our analysis has revealed discernible disparities in the allocation of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) across different ethnic communities. Specifically, the data indicates a higher rate of increment in predominantly white neighborhoods within TIF-designated areas, compared to those predominantly inhabited by Black and Hispanic residents. These findings suggest an uneven distribution of TIF investments, which may contribute to persistent inequalities. It is our intention to disseminate these findings broadly, not only to inform the general public but also to engage local government officials and media outlets. By doing so, we aim to promote a more equitable allocation of TIF resources and to stimulate informed public discourse on this critical issue.

## Limitation
While our findings indicate a higher rate of increase in predominantly white TIF areas, it is important to acknowledge that these outcomes may not be solely attributable to TIF allocations. The existing socioeconomic conditions, such as the higher median incomes historically present in these areas, may also play a significant role. These economic advantages could potentially enhance the effectiveness of investments, contributing to the observed disparities. Therefore, it is essential to consider that economic growth is influenced by a multitude of factors, and pinpointing TIF investments as the sole element requiring adjustment may oversimplify the complexities of urban economic development. This acknowledgment underlines the need for a multifaceted approach in further research and policy-making to ensure equitable economic advancement across all communities.
